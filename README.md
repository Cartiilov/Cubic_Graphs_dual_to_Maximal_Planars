## Introduction
Cubic graphs, also known as 3-regular graphs, are graphs where each vertex has exactly three edges. Maximal planar graphs are planar graphs that cannot have any additional edges added without losing their planarity. This project focuses on the dual relationship between these two types of graphs.

## Project Goal
The goal of the project is to study random maps on the sphere using Monte Carlo simulations. A random map in the project is represented by a random planar cubic graph, which is dual to a random planar triangulation. The work focuses on determining the distribution of the number of neighboring countries, as well as the distances between them in terms of the minimum number of countries that must be traversed to travel from one country to another.

## Usage
To generate and analyze cubic graphs dual to maximal planar graphs, use the provided scripts in the `scripts` directory. Example usage:
```bash
python scripts/generate_graph.py
```
